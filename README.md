# LooksRare Solidity test

Your goal is to get as many tests to pass as possible.

`forge test`

1. For each question, besides implementing the solution, you *should* also explain why you decided to implement your solution
in a certain way.

2. Note that some questions do not require you to write code, but instead requires you to explain the code behaves in a certain way.

Good luck!
